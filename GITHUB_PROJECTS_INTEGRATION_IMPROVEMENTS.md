# GitHub Projects Integration Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **"Unknown action" Error**
   - Fixed the GitHub Projects API endpoint to properly handle repository requests
   - Updated `handleGetRepositories` function to fetch repositories from GitHub API instead of returning an empty array
   - Ensured proper error handling and response formatting

2. **Meaningful Task Titles and Descriptions**
   - Added document parsing to extract structured sections from SDLC documents
   - Implemented `sdlc-document-parser.ts` utility to parse markdown headers into subsections
   - Ensured default subsections are created if none are found in the document

3. **Organization by Category**
   - Fixed issue where SDLC document was passed as a string instead of structured object
   - Implemented proper parsing of business analysis, functional spec, technical spec, and UX sections
   - Ensured tasks are properly categorized by SDLC phase

## New Components

1. **GitHub Projects Creator Component**
   - Created a reusable component for GitHub Projects creation
   - Added repository selection, project naming, and configuration options
   - Implemented proper error handling and success messaging

2. **Visual Progress Tracking**
   - Added `GitHubProjectsVisualProgress` component to show creation progress
   - Implemented step-by-step progress indicators with status icons
   - Added visual feedback for each stage of the process:
     - Analyzing SDLC documents
     - Creating GitHub project structure
     - Generating GitHub issues
     - Setting up project workflows
     - Syncing with SDLC phases

## Implementation Details

1. **Document Parsing**
   - `parseDocumentSections`: Parses markdown headers into subsections
   - `parseSDLCDocument`: Extracts sections from comprehensive documents
   - `ensureDefaultSubsections`: Creates default subsections if none are found

2. **API Improvements**
   - Updated repository fetching to use GitHub REST API
   - Improved error handling and response formatting
   - Added proper token handling for authenticated requests

3. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Updated dashboard to use document parser before sending data to API
   - Added visual progress tracking during GitHub Projects creation
   - Improved user feedback with clear error and success messages

## Results

- GitHub Projects now creates tasks with meaningful titles and descriptions
- Tasks are properly organized by category (Business Analysis, Functional Spec, Technical, UX)
- Users receive visual feedback during the creation process
- The integration is more robust and handles errors gracefully

## Future Improvements

- Add support for custom issue templates
- Implement project board customization
- Add support for assigning team members to issues
- Implement GitHub Projects automation rules
