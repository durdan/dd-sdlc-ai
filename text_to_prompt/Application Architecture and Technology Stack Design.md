# Application Architecture and Technology Stack Design

Based on the research into user requirements and existing UI generation technologies, this section outlines the architecture and technology stack for developing an application that generates detailed wireframe UI designs from natural language prompts, mimicking the output of a professional UX designer.

## System Architecture Overview

The application will follow a client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns between the frontend user interface, backend processing logic, and AI model integration. The system will be designed to be scalable, maintainable, and capable of producing high-fidelity wireframes that meet professional UX standards.

### Core Components

The system architecture consists of several key components that work together to transform user prompts into detailed wireframe designs:

**Frontend Interface:** A web-based user interface that allows users to input their requirements through natural language prompts and view the generated wireframe designs. This component will provide an intuitive experience for describing application requirements and iterating on generated designs.

**Backend API Server:** A RESTful API server that handles user requests, processes prompts, orchestrates AI model interactions, and manages the wireframe generation pipeline. This server acts as the central coordinator for all system operations.

**AI Model Integration Layer:** A specialized component responsible for interfacing with Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI services to interpret user prompts and generate structured wireframe data. This layer abstracts the complexity of AI model interactions and provides a consistent interface for wireframe generation.

**Wireframe Generation Engine:** The core logic that transforms AI-interpreted requirements into detailed wireframe specifications, including layout calculations, component placement, content integration, and visual hierarchy establishment.

**Rendering Engine:** A component that converts wireframe specifications into visual representations, supporting multiple output formats such as SVG, HTML/CSS, or integration with design tools like Figma.

**Data Storage Layer:** A database system for storing user prompts, generated wireframes, design templates, and system configuration data to support features like version history and template libraries.
