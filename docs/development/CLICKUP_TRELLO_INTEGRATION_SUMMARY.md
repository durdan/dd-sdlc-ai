## Usage Examples

### ClickUp Integration
```typescript
// Create SDLC task in ClickUp
const clickUpService = new ClickUpService(apiToken);
const result = await clickUpService.createSDLCTask(listId, {
  title: "Implement Authentication Feature",
  description: "Add JWT-based authentication to the API",
  priority: "high",
  assignees: ["user123"],
  tags: ["authentication", "security"],
  dueDate: new Date("2024-02-15"),
  subtasks: [
    { name: "Design JWT structure", assignees: ["user123"] },
    { name: "Implement login endpoint", assignees: ["user456"] },
    { name: "Add middleware", assignees: ["user123"] }
  ]
});
```

### Trello Integration
```typescript
// Create SDLC card in Trello
const trelloService = new TrelloService(apiKey, token);
const result = await trelloService.createSDLCCard(listId, {
  title: "Database Schema Design",
  description: "Design and implement the database schema for user management",
  assignees: ["member123"],
  labels: ["database", "backend"],
  dueDate: new Date("2024-02-20"),
  checklist: {
    name: "Implementation Tasks",
    items: [
      "Create user table",
      "Add indexes",
      "Write migration scripts",
      "Update documentation"
    ]
  }
});
```

## Integration with SDLC Platform

Both integrations are designed to work seamlessly with your SDLC automation platform:

### Automated Task Creation
- When SDLC documentation is generated, tasks/cards can be automatically created
- Requirements are broken down into actionable items
- Team members are assigned based on expertise

### Status Synchronization
- Task/card status updates reflect SDLC progress
- Due dates are managed automatically
- Progress tracking is unified across platforms

### Notification Management
- Team members receive notifications about task assignments
- Due date reminders are synchronized
- Comments and updates are tracked

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- API keys and tokens are stored securely in integration settings
- Credentials are encrypted in transit and at rest
- No credentials are logged or exposed in client-side code

### Access Control
- Integration respects existing team permissions
- Only authorized users can configure integrations
- API access is limited to necessary operations

## Error Handling

Both services include comprehensive error handling:
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid API credentials
- Rate limiting
- Missing permissions
- Invalid resource IDs

Errors are logged appropriately and user-friendly messages are displayed in the UI.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Webhook support for real-time synchronization
- Advanced automation rules
- Custom field mapping
- Bulk operations
- Integration with other SDLC tools
- Analytics and reporting
- Template management
