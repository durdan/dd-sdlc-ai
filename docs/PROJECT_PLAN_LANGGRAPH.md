# SDLC.dev LangGraph.js Migration - Detailed Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This document serves as the master project plan for migrating SDLC.dev from its current sequential document generation system to an advanced multi-agent orchestration architecture using LangGraph.js. The new architecture incorporates Router-Orchestrator-Worker patterns, parallel processing capabilities, and intelligent synthesis mechanisms as illustrated in the provided design diagrams.

## Architecture Analysis

### Pattern 1: Router-Orchestrator-Worker-Synthesizer Flow

Based on your first diagram, we'll implement a hierarchical flow:

```
Router → Orchestrator → Workers (1..N) → Synthesizer → Evaluators
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Router**: Intelligent request classification and routing
- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination and task distribution
- **Workers**: Parallel specialized processing
- **Synthesizer**: Result aggregation and coherence
- **Evaluators**: Quality assurance and validation

### Pattern 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration with Shared State

From your sequence diagram, we identify:
- **Planner Agent**: Decomposes tasks into actionable items
- **Worker Agents**: Execute specific document sections
- **Shared State/CP**: Checkpoint and state management
- **Synthesizer**: Combines outputs into coherent documents
- **Evaluator**: Reviews and validates quality
- **Human Approver**: Final review checkpoint

### Pattern 3: Comprehensive Workflow Architecture

Your third diagram shows:
- **Routing Policy with LLM fallback**
- **Dynamic worker assignment**
- **State persistence layer**
- **Quality gates and approval checkpoints**
- **External tool integration**

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Branch Management

```bash
# Current situation
main branch: Latest stable version
feature/subsection-generation-formatting: Sub-document generation features

# Migration approach
1. Create new feature branch from main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/langgraph-migration

2. Merge subsection features
   git merge feature/subsection-generation-formatting
   # Resolve conflicts, focusing on preserving sub-document logic

3. Implement LangGraph architecture
   # Development on feature/langgraph-migration

4. Regular sync with main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout feature/langgraph-migration
   git merge main
```

### 2. Incremental Migration Path

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Current System] --> B[Parallel Development]
    B --> C[Feature Flag Control]
    C --> D[A/B Testing]
    D --> E[Gradual Rollout]
    E --> F[Full Migration]
    
    B --> G[Fallback Ready]
    G --> C
```

**Stage 1: Parallel Development**
- Keep existing system operational
- Develop LangGraph system alongside
- Share database and authentication

**Stage 2: Feature Flag Introduction**
```typescript
interface FeatureFlags {
  useNewRouter: boolean;
  useNewOrchestrator: boolean;
  useNewWorkers: boolean;
  useNewSynthesizer: boolean;
  percentageRollout: number;
}
```

**Stage 3: A/B Testing**
- 10% traffic to new system
- Monitor metrics
- Gather feedback
- Iterate on issues

**Stage 4: Gradual Rollout**
- 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
- Monitor at each stage
- Ready to rollback if needed

### 3. Data Migration

```typescript
// Migration utilities
class DataMigrator {
  async migratePrompts(): Promise<void> {
    // Convert prompts to agent configurations
  }
  
  async migrateProjects(): Promise<void> {
    // Ensure project compatibility
  }
  
  async migrateDocuments(): Promise<void> {
    // Convert documents to new format
  }
}
```

### 4. API Compatibility Layer

```typescript
// Backward compatibility
class CompatibilityAdapter {
  async handleLegacyRequest(request: LegacyRequest): Promise<Response> {
    // Convert to new format
    const newRequest = this.transformRequest(request);
    
    // Process with new system
    const result = await this.newSystem.process(newRequest);
    
    // Convert response to legacy format
    return this.transformResponse(result);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive project plan provides a clear roadmap for migrating SDLC.dev to a sophisticated multi-agent architecture using LangGraph.js. The plan incorporates the Router-Orchestrator-Worker-Synthesizer pattern from your design diagrams, ensuring parallel processing, intelligent task distribution, and high-quality document generation.

Key success factors:
1. **Incremental migration** with fallback mechanisms
2. **Comprehensive testing** at each phase
3. **Performance monitoring** throughout
4. **Team alignment** on architecture and goals
5. **Risk mitigation** strategies in place

The 13-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with proper resource allocation and focus. Regular checkpoints and milestones ensure we can adjust course as needed while maintaining momentum toward the production deployment.
